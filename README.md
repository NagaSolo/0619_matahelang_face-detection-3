- repo: github.co/NagaSolo/0619_matahelang_face-detection-3
- face detection computer vision, for all time sake; completed it once in a tinkerer way

### Idea
- Computer Vision Project Idea â€“ Face detection is a technique to find the location of the human faces in an image. 
- Computers use various types of algorithms to detect if the shape in the image resembles a face or not. 
- Build an app to automatically detect faces and capture the image in our system.

### Opportunity
- Many uses

### Progress
- download library from here: *http://libccv.org/tutorial/* -> `DONE`
    - library is full of bug
- use library -> `WIP`
- finding alternatives to `OpenCV`
    - `libcvv` too buggy
    - from scratch cv `not enough resources`
